Heart Disease Prediction


Heart Disease Finder Idea : 
The main idea of the project is to predict the presence/absence of heart disease with a given 
list of parameters from the User. Once the prediction is done, if the user is liable for a heart disease, 
the app tends to find all the possible heart disease and the respective services provided for the disease.
The location of the nearest hospital is found and plotted in map, so that the user can go for a checkup. 
The cost range of different service providers close-by the location can be listed. The app redirects to certain 
preventive/dietary measures in case of heart diseases.
